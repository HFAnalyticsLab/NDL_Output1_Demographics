# Networked Data Lab: Demographic characteristics of shielded patients

#### Project Status: In progess

## Project Description

This Networked Data Lab analysis will focus on clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) people, also known as the shielding population - the group of people most at risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 . This group were asked to not leave their homes and to minimise all face-to-face contact up until the end of July 2020 in most of the UK. Whilst the shielding guidance was paused over Summer, people were once again asked to minimise their contact with others from November.

We are using a federated approach to data analysis and each partner will be contributing the same descriptive analysis based on their local population. These results will then be analysed and aggregated where necessary.

The analysis will allow us to have a better understanding of who makes up this group of people and better understand their health care needs. This first output focuses on the demographics of CEV people.

## Partners

The following partners have taken part in this analysis and contributed results:

- The Aberdeen Centre for Health Data Science (ACHDS) which includes NHS Grampian and the University of Aberdeen
- Public Health Wales, NHS Wales Informatics Service (NWIS), Swansea University (SAIL Databank) and Social Care Wales (SCW)
- Imperial College Health Partners (ICHP), Institute of Global Health Innovation (IGHI), Imperial College London (ICL), and North West London CCGs
- Liverpool CCG, Healthy Wirral Partnership and Citizens Advice Bureau
- Leeds CCG and Leeds City Council    

## Data sources

This analysis relies on the following data sources, which have been accessed by NDL partners.

- The Shielded Patient List (SPL).
- Patient demographics databases.
- External Open data sources linked to a patientsâ€™ LSOA (or other geography) of residence. These are the 2019 [English](https://data-communities.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d4b79be994ac4820ad44e10ded313df3_0

## How does it work?

The repository contains the following folders:

- **Extraction:** this contains summaries from each partner on how they extracted their data and defined their cohorts.
- **Standardization and cleaning:** this contains .R code from each partner to clean data and create the required variables for this analysis (e.g. age bands). The goal is to make the five datasets as similar to each other as possible.
- **Analysis:** this contains the .R code used by each partner for their analyses, using clean data to produce summary statistic tables on patient demographics. This folder also includes the code used by The Health Foundation (THF) to aggregate and analyse the five sets of results.
- **Outputs:** this contains the final outputs from each of the parnters (after applying statistical disclosure control methods).
